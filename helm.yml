.helmignore: it is used to define all the files that we dont want to include the helm chart

chart.yml: it contains information about the helm chart like version, name, description, type, maintainer etc..

charts: we can add another chart's structure inside this directory if out main charts have some 
        dependency on others. by default this directory is empty ..

templates: this directory contains all the k8s manifest files that form an application
           by default helm charts creates some default templates for k8s objects like service, deployment etc..

values.yml: in this file wwe define the values for the yml template image name,replica
            count, HPA values, secrets, etc... and we can override these values dynamically or at the 
            time of installing the chart using -- values

NODES.txt: this is text file that print out after the chart is successfully deployed

_helper.tpl: helm allows for the use of GO templating in resource files for k8s
